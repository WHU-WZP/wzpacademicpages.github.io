## Ph.D. dissertation: Research on AlN-based Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer and the Range-finding System
 (Supervisor: Professor Chengliang Sun and Liang Lou)<br/>
This research is focus on the development of ultrasonic range-finding sensor based on the AlN PMUTs and the fusion of robot and MEMS sensor. In this dissertation, an ultrasonic range-finding system based on AlN PMUTs is proposed. Then the above system is used on a collaborative robot. Finally, a human-robot interaction based on AlN PMUTs and the collaborative robot is realized. The main content of this dissertation is as follows:<br/>
1. The influence of ringdown on AlN PMUTs and the strategy for suppressing ring-down:<br/>
(1) The method of adjusting the characteristics of AlN PMUTs through the DC bias voltage is proposed, and the effects of DC bias voltage on characteristics for AlN PMUTs are investigated.As DC bias voltage is applied to the AlN piezoelectric layer, it would produce controllable stress leading to the variation of device response. As shown in Fig1 and Fig2, when the DC bias voltage is adjusted between -30 to 30V, experimental, the simulation results and experiment results show that characteristics such as the resonance frequency, the -3dB bandwidth(BW), and the Q vary almost linearly with respect to the bias voltage, which demonstrates the characteristics of AlN PMUTs can be adjusted through DC bias voltage. Compared to the non-biased condition, the -3dB BW is increased by 9.09% at 30V, whereas the Q is decreased by 6.96% at 30V. Increasing the BW and decreasing the Q would allow the ring-down time to be shorter. As shown in Fig3, compared to the non-biased condition, the ring-down time is decreased by 3.03% at 30V. As shown in Fig4, the biased PMUTs can cover an effective frequency range of 4.66 kHz through technology like frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), which is an increment of 370.71%, compared to an effective frequency range of only 0.99 kHz at non-biased conditions. This provides more potential applications, such as ultrasonic communication.<br/>
