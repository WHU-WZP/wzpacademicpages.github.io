Ph.D. dissertation: Research on AlN-based Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer and the Range-finding System
 (Supervisor: Professor Chengliang Sun and Liang Lou)
This research is focus on the development of ultrasonic range-finding sensor based on the AlN PMUTs and the fusion of robot and MEMS sensor. The main content of this dissertation is as follows:
1. The influence of ringdown on AlN PMUTs and the strategy for suppressing ring-down:
(1) The method of adjusting the characteristics of AlN PMUTs through the DC bias voltage is proposed, and the effects of DC bias voltage on characteristics for AlN PMUTs are investigated.
(2) A novel ring-down suppression system based on transfer function is proposed to suppress the ring-down time and decrease the blind area of PMUTs.
2.The design of an ultrasonic range-finding system based on AlN PMUTs:
(1) Designed an ultrasonic range-finding sensor based on AlN PMUTs, which is mounted on FPCB and can be applied on the surface of UR3 manipulator.
(2) Built the scheme of the range-finding system and designed the digital signal processing program through LabVIEW.
(3) Realized ultrasonic writing in a two-dimensional plane based the proposed ultrasonic range-finding system.
3.The design of a human-robot interaction system based on AlN PMUTs and the UR3 manipulator:
(1) Built the scheme of the human-robot interaction system based on the UR3 manipulator and the above ultrasonic range-finding sensor.
(2) Gesture recognition is demonstrated through this system, then this information can control the motion of UR3 manipulator through ROS.
(3) The built human-robot interaction system can realize gesture tracking and obstacle avoidance.
