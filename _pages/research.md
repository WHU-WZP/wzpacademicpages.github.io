## Ph.D. dissertation: Research on AlN-based Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer and the Range-finding System
 (Supervisor: Professor Chengliang Sun and Liang Lou)<br/>
This research is focus on the development of ultrasonic range-finding sensor based on the AlN PMUTs and the fusion of robot and MEMS sensor. The main content of this dissertation is as follows:<br/>
1. The influence of ringdown on AlN PMUTs and the strategy for suppressing ring-down:<br/>
(1) The method of adjusting the characteristics of AlN PMUTs through the DC bias voltage is proposed, and the effects of DC bias voltage on characteristics for AlN PMUTs are investigated.<br/>
(2) A novel ring-down suppression system based on transfer function is proposed to suppress the ring-down time and decrease the blind area of PMUTs.<br/>
2. The design of an ultrasonic range-finding system based on AlN PMUTs:<br/>
(1) Designed an ultrasonic range-finding sensor based on AlN PMUTs, which is mounted on FPCB and can be applied on the surface of UR3 manipulator.<br/>
