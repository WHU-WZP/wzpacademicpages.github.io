This research is focus on the development of ultrasonic range-finding sensor based on the AlN PMUTs and the fusion of robot and MEMS sensor. In this dissertation, an ultrasonic range-finding system based on AlN PMUTs is proposed. Then the above system is used on a collaborative robot. Finally, a human-robot interaction based on AlN PMUTs and the collaborative robot is realized. The main content of this dissertation is as follows:<br/>
1.The influence of ringdown on AlN PMUTs and the strategy for suppressing ring-down.<br/>
(1) The method of adjusting the characteristics of AlN PMUTs through the DC bias voltage is proposed, and the effects of DC bias voltage on characteristics for AlN PMUTs are investigated.<br/>
(2) A novel ring-down suppression system based on transfer function is proposed to suppress the ring-down time and decrease the blind area of PMUTs.<br/>
2.The design of an ultrasonic range-finding system based on AlN PMUTs.<br/>
3.The design of a human-robot interaction system based on AlN PMUTs and the UR3 manipulator.<br/>
